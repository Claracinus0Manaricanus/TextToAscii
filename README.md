# TextToAscii
this project is to turn text file into ascii format (decimal) and output it as a file.

How To Use:
It comes as a .out file which you can run with ./tta.out on terminal on linux systems.
If you get permission denied error run chmod +x tta.out  .
Now run ./tta.out again and it should work.
(tta stands for text to ascii)
It will require some input, first the full name of the file you want to use, then the full name of the output file.
